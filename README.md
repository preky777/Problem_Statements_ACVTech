## Task List

The following tasks have been completed in this project the document containing the tasks is uploaded "Task from Acviss Technologies.doc":

    1.	Write a function to reverse a string.
    2.	Implement a function to find the factorial of a number.
    3.	Write a script that sorts a list of integers in ascending order.
    4.	Use Pandas to load a CSV file, clean the data (handling missing values, standardizing formats), and perform basic analysis (e.g., finding mean, median, mode).
    5.	Write a script that takes a JSON file, reads it, and processes the data to find specific information (like the maximum value in a list of numbers).
    6.	Implement a simple search algorithm (e.g., binary search).
    7.	Write a script to interact with a public API, retrieve data, and process it (e.g., getting weather data and displaying it in a user-friendly format).
    8.	Working with Databases: Write a Python script to connect to a database (like SQLite or MongoDB), insert some data, retrieve it, and perform a simple query.
    9.	Create a script that automates a simple task, such as renaming multiple files in a directory based on a specific pattern.
    10.	Write a script that periodically checks a website and sends an email notification if specific content is updated.


## Content

- Two important folders 'Questions_and_Files' and 'Solution' are present
- The 'Questions_and_Files' folder has the questions/task in a word document, has 2 other folders 'files_4th_question' and 'json_file_9th_question' the name itself suggests what they are.
- The 'Solution' folder has the Jupyter Notebook: 'Solutions.ipynb', has 2 other folders 'cleaned_files_4th_question' and 'folder_for_10th_question' the name itself suggests what they are.
- The jupyter notebook contains all the solutions for the task.
- Python programming (Python 3) is used.


## Task Descriptions

    Task 1: Program in the jupyter notebbok.
    Task 2: Program in the jupyter notebbok.
    Task 3: Program in the jupyter notebbok.
    Task 4: Two csv tasks are performed here file.csv has the data after all the cleaning and the basic analysis cleaned_file.csv has the cleaned data same is the case with file1.csv and cleaned_file1.csv
    Task 5: Here the JSON file is 'data.json' and all the asked tasks are performed in the jupyter notebook
    Task 6: Program in the jupyter notebbok.
    Task 7: Program in the jupyter notebbok. Site used for the API is OpenWeather
    Task 8: Program in the jupyter notebbok. Database used is MongoDB.
    Task 9: Program in the jupyter notebbok. Folder on which the pgm is performed is reports, it has 3 files that have been renamed, proof are the Screenshots(4 screenshots in total).
    Task 10: Program in the jupyter notebbok.
